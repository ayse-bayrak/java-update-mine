Given the following classes:
class Shape { /* ... */ }
class Circle extends Shape { /* ... */ }
class Rectangle extends Shape { /* ... */ }
class Node<T> { /* ... */ }
Will the following code compile? If not, why?
Node<Circle> nc = new Node<>();
Node<Shape> ns = nc;

Node<Circle> nc = new Node<>(); // in here nc Node<Circle>
Node is only accepting one value, T means whatever you passing over.
you can not assign to different things

Generic does not care extends,
i don't accept any other object types i don't accept Shape class
